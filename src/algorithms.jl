    alloc_hh22_1(V::Additive, C::Counts; α=0.5)

The 1/2-approximate MMS allocation under cardinality constraints algorithm
(Algorithm 3) described by Hummel and Hetland in their [Maximin Shares Under
Cardinality Constraints](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-20614-6_11) (2022).
First the instance is reduced to an ordered normalized instance where each good
is worth less than 1/2. While there are more than one agent remaining, the
algorithm creates a bundle with the ``⌊|\\text{category}|/n⌋`` lowest-valued
items in each category. Repeatedly, it converts each of these to the
highest-valued remaining item in the category until it either runs out of items
to convert or an agent values the bundle at least 1/2. If the procedure runs out
of items to convert, it adds the highest-valued remaining item in each category,
in order, to get ``⌈|\\text{category}|/n⌉`` items from each category.  After
each such item is added, the value is again checked for each agent. Since the
instance was ordered normalized and without items worth 1/2 or more, the bundle
created will always be worth more than 1/2 to one of the remaining agents before
the procedure runs out of items to add to it or convert from low- to
high-valued.

Another approximation ratio, `α`, can be supplied. If `α ≤ 0.5` the algorithm is
guaranteed to succeed. Otherwise, the method will try to find an allocation with
an approximation ratio of `α`, but may fail. In the latter case, the results
will indicate a failure by setting `res.fail` to `true`.

Allocate items to agents randomly, respecting the item conflicts. Uses the

symmetry-breaking](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-70575-8_26) of Pemmaraju

1. Give the items random priorities, corresponding to a permutation selected
   uniformly at ramdom.
2. Tentatively allocate each item randomly to an agent, without concern for the
   item conflicts.
3. If an agent has received conflicting items, it keeps the highest-priority
   item (i.e., earliest in the permutation), and the others are reallocated
   arbitrarily.

This final arbitrary reallocation is also performed randomly in this
implementation, by going through the items in random order, allocating each to a
randomly selected agent among those able to receive it.

The valuation profile `V` is not used, other than to determine the number of
agents and items.

For this algorithm to function properly, the maximum degree of the conflict
graph should be strictly less than the number of agents.

    alloc_bkv18_1(V; randpri=true)

The first algorithm (**Alg-Identical**) described by Barman, Krishnamurty and
Vaish in their 2018 paper [Greedy Algorithms for Maximizing Nash Social
Welfare](http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09046). The algorithm finds a 1.061-approximate
MNW allocation when agents have identical valuations, i.e., for any agents `i`,
`j` and item `g`, `value(V, i, g) == value(V, j, g)`. (This approximation ratio
applies to the geometric mean of agent utilities, not the raw product.) The
result will also be envy-free up to any item (EFX).

The algorithm follows a straightforward greedy allocation procedure, where in
each iteration, the most valuable item is allocated to the agent with the lowest
utility. By default, ties are broken by giving the agents random priorities; if
`randpri` is set to false, they are instead broken lexicographically (as
specified by Barman et al.), so that the agent with the lower index is
preferred.

# e.g., use one of the structures developed for dynamically updating transitive
# closures. Because the graph in question is one with the agents as its
# vertices, which means it will probably be quite small, any asymptotic
# improvements could quite possibly be swamped by overhead. For now, things are
# kept simple, with a fresh traversal for each agent pair.

"""
    alloc_bkv18_2(V; randpri=true, complete=false)
    alloc_hpps20_1(V; randpri=true, complete=false) # alias

The second algorithm (**Alg-Binary**) described by Barman, Krishnamurty and
Vaish in their 2018 paper [Greedy Algorithms for Maximizing Nash Social
Welfare](http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09046). The algorithm finds MNW allocations
in polynomial time for binary additive valuations, i.e., where each agent values
any given object at 0 or 1 (e.g., an `Additive{BitMatrix}`). It also works in a
more general setting, where `value(V, i, S)`, for any given `i`, is a concave
function of the number of items `g` in `S` for which `value(V, i, g) == 1`.

The original algorithm builds on an initial allocation, but does not specify
what this allocation should be. It also does not deal with the case where one or
more agents ends up with zero utility; in fact the procedure will not work even
if we start with two or more agents with zero utility in the intial allocation.
The strategy followed here is the same as that of [Caragiannis et
al.](https://doi.org/10.1145/3355902), where a maximum cardinality set of agents
achieving positive utility is found using bipartite matching (with no fairness
considerations). The remaining items are randomly allocated to agents among
these that value them, if any. Remaining agents and items are ignored by the
procedure.

Following the algorithm of Barman et al., the tie-breaking procedure
(Algorithm 1) of [Halpern et al.](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06073) is used,
where the MNW allocation is transformed into the lexicographically greatest MNW,
according to some ordering of the agents, providing group-strategyproofness
(GSP) in addition to the EF1 and PO guarantees that follow from MNW. By default,
the agent ordering/priority is random; if this randomization is turned off (with
`randpri` set to false), the default ordering is used, with agent `1` receiving
the highest priority, etc.

!!! note

    Despite the use of randomization here, by default, this is the
    *deterministic* procedure of Halpern et al. They also describe a randomized
    procedure, which functions in an entirely different manner.

Finally, if the `complete` argument is set to `true`, the allocation is
completed with `fill_even!` (which means that some agents that must necessarily
get a utility of zero can still receive items valued zero, if that evens out the
bundle cardinalities). Note that this undermines the GSP guarantee, which
requires that these items be discarded. The return value is a named tuple with
the fields `alloc` (the `Allocation`) and `mnw` (the Nash welfare, ignoring
agents with zero utility).

Generalizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00222). The algorithm finds a
1/3-approximate MMS allocation for a given submodular instance. The method
starts by overestimating the MMS of each agent and slowly decreasing the MMS of
specific agents until `alloc_ghss18_4` returns an allocation.

The amount that the MMS of an agent should be reduced by in each iteration is
not specified by Ghodsi et al. One can show that if the factor is `1/(1 + 1/x)`,
where `x ≥ 3n - 1`, then the algorithm will successfully find a 1/3-approximate
MMS allocation. One way to show this, is to modify Lemma 4.6 in their paper to
assume that each of the bundles `Sᵢ` is valued at least `1/(1 + 1/x)`. Using
this modified version of Lemma 4.6, one can modify the proof of Theorem 4.7 to
show that as long as `x ≥ 3n - 1`, the change in expectance from moving an item
is at least `1/(3m)`. The value of `x` used in this implementation is `x = an`,
where the keyword argument `a` is set to `3` by default (i.e., `x = 3n`). If `a`
is set so that `x < 3n - 1` a warning will be given. The warning can be turned
off by setting `x_warn` to `false`.

The 1/3-approximate MMS-allocation under cardinality constraints algorithm
(Section 5) described by Biswas and Barman in their 2018 paper [Fair Division
Under Cardinality Constraints] (https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/13). Finds a
1/3-approximate MMS allocation for an instance of the fair allocation problem
under cardinality constraints by converting the additive instance under
cardinality constraints to a submodular instance without cardinality
constraints. The allocation is then found by using the method of Ghodsi et al.
(`alloc_ghss18_4b`), with possible reallocation of items to satisfy the
constraints. Both keyword arguments, `a` and `ghss18_4b_warn`, are passed
directly to `alloc_ghss18_4b` as respectively the keyword arguments `a` and
`x_warn`. See [`alloc_ghss18_4b`](@ref) for documentation on how to use them.

The algorithm finds a 2/3-approximate MMS allocation for an instance with
additive valuations. The algorithm works by performing a set of reductions to
simplify the instance, limiting the maximum value of a good and the number of
high-valued goods. The algorithm then uses bag-filling to allocate the remaining
goods to the remaining agents.
